# Exploring the Impact of Key Factors on the Sales Trend of New Vehicles in Australia (1994-2017)

This repository contains a detailed analysis of the factors influencing the sales trends of new vehicles in Australia between 1994 and 2017. The study explores the impact of vehicle types, state-wise sales performance, and seasonal variations in sales.

## Overview
The aim of this research is to identify the key factors affecting the sales of new vehicles in Australia and analyze trends over time. The dataset was sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, and various statistical methods were applied, including Kruskal-Wallis tests and regression modeling, to uncover insights.

## Key Findings
- **Vehicle Type**: Passenger vehicles had the highest median sales, while sports utility vehicles had the lowest.
- **State-wise Sales**: New South Wales recorded the highest sales, and Tasmania the lowest.
- **Monthly Sales**: Sales peaked in June, while January and April saw the lowest sales numbers.
- **Predictive Model**: A regression model was built to predict sales based on state and vehicle type, explaining 62% of the sales variance.

## Contents
- **Report**: The full analysis report can be found [here](link-to-uploaded-pdf).
- **Methodology**: Details on data collection, cleaning, and statistical analysis performed.
- **Statistical Tests**: Kruskal-Wallis tests for vehicle type and state, along with regression modeling for sales predictions.

## Recommendations
1. Focus production on passenger vehicles due to higher sales.
2. Allocate more resources to New South Wales, where sales are highest.
3. Increase vehicle production during June to maximize sales.
4. Further research is needed to understand other influencing factors like consumer behavior and economic conditions.

## Limitations
- Data limitations may impact generalization.
- The model did not account for all possible factors influencing sales, such as market competition and consumer preferences.
